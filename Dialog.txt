Alerts: urgent interruptions that inform about a situation.
Alerts without title bars
Asking a question (e.g. "Delete this image?")
Alerts with title bars
Use a clear question or statement with an explanation in the content area, such as "Erase USB storage?".
Simple menu:display options for list items.
Confirmation dialogs: require users to explicitly confirm a choice.

Full-screen dialog titles:

Full-screen dialog titles can wrap to a second line if necessary, and then should be truncated.
when words are longer, titles may need to wrap.

Example:

import React from 'react';
import Dialog from 'material-ui/Dialog';
import FlatButton from 'material-ui/FlatButton';
import RaisedButton from 'material-ui/RaisedButton';

/**
 * Dialog with action buttons. The actions are passed in as an array of React objects,
 * in this example [FlatButtons](/#/components/flat-button).
 *
 * You can also close this dialog by clicking outside the dialog, or with the 'Esc' key.
